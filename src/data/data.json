All members of Bennington’s Literature faculty have published book-length works of fiction, poetry, creative nonfiction, literary journalism, or translation. While applications from writers in all genres are welcome, we are particularly interested in considering fiction writers, creative nonfiction writers, and dual-genre authors for the position. Applicants should have a strong record of publication, including at least one book published or under contract with a nationally recognized press.\n",

We serve a diverse student population, and our faculty and staff also reflect diverse backgrounds and identities. Our aim is to educate students towards self-fulfillment and constructive social purposes, and we believe that equity, diversity, and inclusivity--in community and in curriculum--are vital to achieving those aims. \n",
